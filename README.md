Gigachad aka @MannimarcoSimp here.

An artst,linux "enthusiast" and wanna be programmer,
I mainly focus on studying Python, C++, HTML and JS from PLs for now,
as my grandma would say "I'm pretty good at computers" while this statement is correct,
in reality I dont like them, they make our lives worse in the long run, 
but they're unavoidable step for the humanity, so shall be it.
Not going to publish my works for now, just here for the fact of it mainly.
However,I likely will publish/collab/make commits in future. 

Et aussi, j'etudie francais,
А такжe русский это мой родной язык, 
не очень часто им пользуюсь впрочем.
